# AquaSpice-Thesis_Data-Analysis-Science-for-Water-Quality-Data

This is my diploma thesis in which data analysis and data scienece methods are implemented tested and evaluated. 
From the data collection and preprocessing, to the descrptive analysis and feature selection and finally to the implemention of machine learning and ANN models for prediction, are form the procedural flow of the thesis.
ARIMA, SARIMAX , univariate Multi-Layer-Perceptron for prediction and multivariate Long-Short-Term-Memory RNNs are being implemented tested and evaluated with the aim of prediction.
