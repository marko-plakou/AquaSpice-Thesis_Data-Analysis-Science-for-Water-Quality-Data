# AquaSpice-Thesis_Data-Analysis-Science-for-Water-Quality-Data

This is my diploma thesis in which data analysis and data science methods are implemented tested and evaluated. 
The data collection and preprocessing, the descrptive analysis and feature selection and finally the implemention of machine learning and ANN models for prediction, form the procedural flow of the thesis.
ARIMA, SARIMAX , univariate Multi-Layer-Perceptron for prediction and multivariate Long-Short-Term-Memory RNNs are being implemented tested and evaluated with the aim of prediction.
